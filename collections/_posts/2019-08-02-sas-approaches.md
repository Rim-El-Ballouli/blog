### How are self-adaptive systems engineered?

This post is my best effort of making sense of existing works withen 
the field of self-adaptive systems (SAS) after reading 80+ publications on the subject.
 
Extensive efforts have been put by engineers and researchers from different 
disciplines to realize self-adaptive systems. I present here  a mind map categorizing 
the various approaches that have been developed over time. Each 
approach is inspired by a specific discipline and as such, it highlights 
complementary aspects of realizing self-adaptive 
systems. 

The figure below lists the different
disciplines and the several approaches branching from each discipline. 
For instance, developing a self-adaptive system from a control 
engineering perspective implies designing a control-based self-adaptive 
system whose behavior can change according to a set of well-formed mathematical models that 
can be formally analyzed. In coming blog posts we will discuss the details of each approach.
